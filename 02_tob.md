## Origin Dollar Audit

[Report](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/OriginDollar.pdf)

### 34. Origin Dollar

**Finding**: Queued transactions cannot be canceled

**Description**: The `Governor` contract contains special functions to set it as the admin of the `Timelock`. Only the admin can call `Timelock.cancelTransaction`. There are no functions in `Governor` that call `Timelock.cancelTransaction`. This makes it impossible for `Timelock.cancelTransaction` to ever be called.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, add a function to the `Governor` that calls `Timelock.cancelTransaction`. It is unclear who should be able to call it, and what other restrictions there should be around cancelling a transaction.
- Long term, consider letting `Governor` inherit from `Timelock`. This would allow a lot of functions and code to be removed and significantly lower the complexity of these two contracts.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>


### 35. Origin Dollar

**Finding**: Proposal transactions can be executed separately and block `Proposal.execute` call

**Description**: Missing access controls in the `Timelock.executeTransaction` function allow `Proposal` transactions to be executed separately, circumventing the `Governor.execute` function.

**Recommendation**: Short term, only allow the admin to call `Timelock.executeTransaction`

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>


### 36. Origin Dollar

**Finding**: Proposals could allow `Timelock.admin` takeover

**Description**: The Governor contract contains special functions to let the guardian queue a transaction to change the `Timelock.admin`. However, a regular `Proposal` is also allowed to contain a transaction to change the `Timelock.admin`. This poses an unnecessary risk in that an attacker could create a `Proposal` to change the `Timelock.admin`.

**Recommendation**: Short term, add a check that prevents `setPendingAdmin` to be included in a `Proposal`

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>


### 37. Origin Dollar

**Finding**: Reentrancy and untrusted contract call in `mintMultiple`

**Description**: Missing checks and no reentrancy prevention allow untrusted contracts to be called from `mintMultiple`. This could be used by an attacker to drain the contracts.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, add checks that cause `mintMultiple` to revert if the amount is zero or the asset is not supported. Add a reentrancy guard to the `mint`, `mintMultiple`, `redeem`, and `redeemAll` functions.
- Long term, make use of Slither which will flag the reentrancy. Or even better, use Crytic and incorporate static analysis checks into your CI/CD pipeline. Add reentrancy guards to all non-view functions callable by anyone. Make sure to always revert a transaction if an input is incorrect. Disallow calling untrusted contracts.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>


### 38. Origin Dollar

**Finding**: Lack of return value checks can lead to unexpected results

**Description**: Several function calls do not check the return value. Without a return value check, the code is error-prone, which may lead to unexpected results.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, check the return value of all calls mentioned above.
- Long term, subscribe to Crytic.io to catch missing return checks. Crytic identifies this bug type automatically.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>


### 39. Origin Dollar

**Finding**: External calls in loop can lead to denial of service

**Description**: Several function calls are made in unbounded loops. This pattern is error-prone as it can trap the contracts due to the gas limitations or failed transactions.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, review all the loops mentioned above and either:
    1. allow iteration over part of the loop
    2. remove elements.
- Long term, subscribe to Crytic.io to review external calls in loops. Crytic catches bugs of this type.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>


### 40. Origin Dollar

**Finding**: OUSD allows users to transfer more tokens than expected

**Description**: Under certain circumstances, the OUSD contract allows users to transfer more tokens than the ones they have in their balance. This issue seems to be caused by a rounding issue when the `creditsDeducted` is calculated and subtracted.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, make sure the balance is correctly checked before performing all the arithmetic operations. This will make sure it does not allow to transfer more than expected.
- Long term, use Echidna to write properties that ensure ERC20 transfers are transferring the expected amount.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>


### 41. Origin Dollar

**Finding**: OUSD total supply can be arbitrary, even smaller than user balances

**Description**: The OUSD token contract allows users to opt out of rebasing effects. At that point, their exchange rate is “fixed”, and further rebases will not have an impact on token balances (until the user opts in).

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, we would advise making clear all common invariant violations for users and other stakeholders.
- Long term, we would recommend designing the system in such a way to preserve as many commonplace invariants as possible.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>

___
## Yield Protocol

[Report](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/YieldProtocol.pdf)

### 42. Yield Protocol

**Finding**: Flash minting can be used to redeem fyDAI

**Description**: The flash-minting feature from the fyDAI token can be used to redeem an arbitrary amount of funds from a mature token.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, disallow calls to redeem in the YDai and Unwind contracts during flash minting.
- Long term, do not include operations that allow any user to manipulate an arbitrary amount of funds, even if it is in a single transaction. This will prevent attackers from gaining leverage to manipulate the market and break internal invariants.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>


### 43. Yield Protocol

**Finding**: Lack of `chainID` validation allows signatures to be re-used across forks

**Description**: YDai implements the draft ERC 2612 via the `ERC20Permit` contract it inherits from. This allows a third party to transmit a signature from a token holder that modifies the ERC20 allowance for a particular user. These signatures used in calls to `permit` in `ERC20Permit` do not account for chain splits. The `chainID` is included in the domain separator. However, it is not updatable and not included in the signed data as part of the permit call. As a result, if the chain forks after deployment, the signed message may be considered valid on both forks.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, include the `chainID` opcode in the `permit` schema. This will make replay attacks impossible in the event of a post-deployment hard fork.
- Long term, document and carefully review any signature schemas, including their robustness to replay on different wallets, contracts, and blockchains. Make sure users are aware of signing best practices and the danger of signing messages from untrusted sources.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>

___
## Hermez Audit

[Report](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/hermez.pdf)

### 44. Hermez

**Finding**: Lack of a contract existence check allows token theft

**Description**: Since there’s no existence check for contracts that interact with external tokens, an attacker can steal funds by registering a token that’s not yet deployed. `_safeTransferFrom` will return `true` even if the token is not yet deployed, or was self-destructed. An attacker that knows the address of a future token can register the token in `Hermez`, and deposit any amount prior to the token deployment. Once the contract is deployed and tokens have been deposited in `Hermez`, the attacker can steal the funds. The address of a contract to be deployed can be determined by knowing the address of its deployer.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, check for contract existence in `_safeTransferFrom`. Add a similar check for any low-level calls, including in `WithdrawalDelayer`. This will prevent an attacker from listing and depositing tokens in a contract that is not yet deployed.
- Long term, carefully review the Solidity documentation, especially the Warnings section:

> "The low-level call, delegatecall, and callcode will return success if the called account is non-existent, as part of the design of EVM. Existence must be checked prior to calling if desired." - Solidity Docs

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>


### 45. Hermez

**Finding**: No incentive for bidders to vote earlier

**Description**: Hermez relies on a voting system that allows anyone to vote with any weight at the last minute. As a result, anyone with a large fund can manipulate the vote. Hermez’s voting mechanism relies on bidding. There is no incentive for users to bid tokens well before the voting ends. Users can bid a large amount of tokens just before voting ends, and anyone with a large fund can decide the outcome of the vote. As all the votes are public, users bidding earlier will be penalized, because their bids will be known by the other participants. An attacker can know exactly how much currency will be necessary to change the outcome of the voting just before it ends.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, explore ways to incentivize users to vote earlier. Consider a weighted bid, with a weight decreasing over time. While it won’t prevent users with unlimited resources from manipulating the vote at the last minute, it will make the attack more expensive and reduce the chance of vote manipulation.
- Long term, stay up to date with the latest research on blockchain-based online voting and bidding. Blockchain-based online voting is a known challenge. No perfect solution has been found yet.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>


### 46. Hermez

**Finding**: Lack of access control separation is risky

**Description**: The system uses the same account to change both frequently updated parameters and those that require less frequent updates. This architecture is error-prone and increases the severity of any privileged account compromises.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, use a separate account to handle updating the tokens/USD ratio. Using the same account for the critical operations and update the tokens/USD ratio increases underlying risks.
- Long term, document the access controls and set up a proper authorization architecture. Consider the risks associated with each access point and their frequency of usage to evaluate the proper design.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>


### 47. Hermez

**Finding**: Lack of two-step procedure for critical operations leaves them error-prone

**Description**: Several critical operations are done in one function call. This schema is error-prone and can lead to irrevocable mistakes. For example, the setter for the whitehack group address sets the address to the provided argument. If the address is incorrect, the new address will take on the functionality of the new role immediately. However, a two-step process is similar to the `approve`-`transferFrom` functionality: The contract approves the new address for a new role, and the new address acquires the role by calling the contract.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, use a *two-step procedure* for all non-recoverable critical operations to prevent irrecoverable mistakes.
- Long term, identify and document all possible actions and their associated risks for privileged accounts. Identifying the risks will assist codebase review and prevent future mistakes.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>


### 48. Hermez

**Finding**: Initialization functions can be front-run

**Description**: `Hermez`, `HermezAuctionProtocol`, and `WithdrawalDelayer` have initialization functions that can be front-run, allowing an attacker to incorrectly initialize the contracts. Due to the use of the `DELEGATECALL` proxy pattern, `Hermez`, `HermezAuctionProtocol`, and `WithdrawalDelayer` cannot be initialized with a `constructor`, and have `initializer` functions. All these functions can be front-run by an attacker, allowing them to initialize the contracts with malicious values.

**Recommendation**: Short term, either:
1. Use a factory pattern that will prevent front-running of the initialization
2. Ensure the deployment scripts are robust in case of a front-running attack.
Carefully review the Solidity documentation, especially the Warnings section. Carefully review the pitfalls of using delegatecall proxy pattern.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>

## Uniswap V3 Audit

[Report](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v3-core/blob/main/audits/tob/audit.pdf)

### 49. TOB-UNI-001

**Finding**: Missing validation of `_owner` argument could indefinitely lock `owner` role

**Description**:

A lack of input validation of the `_owner` argument in both the constructor and `setOwner` functions could permanently lock the `owner` role, requiring a costly redeploy.

```solidity
// INSECURE CODE from UniswapV3Pool
constructor(address _owner) {
  owner = _owner; // parameter lacks validation
  emit OwnerChanged(address(0), _owner);
  // ...
}

// ...

function setOwner(address _owner) external override {
  require(msg.sender == owner, '00');
  emit OwnerChanged(owner, _owner);
  owner = _owner // parameter lacks validation
}
```
To resolve an incorrect `owner` issue, Uniswap would need to redeploy the factory contract and re-add pairs and liquidity. Users might not be happy to learn of these actions, which could lead to reputational damage. Certain users could also decide to continue using the original factory and pair contracts, in which `owner` functions cannot be called. This could lead to the concurrent use of two versions of Uniswap, one with the original factory contract and no valid `owner` and another in which the `owner` was set correctly.

Trail of Bits identified four distinct cases in which an incorrect owner is set:
1. Passing `address(0)` to the `constructor`
2. Passing `address(0)` to the `setOwner` function
3. Passing an incorrect `address` to the `constructor`
4. Passing an incorrect `address` to the `setOwner` function.

**Recommendation**:

Several improvements could prevent the four above mentioned cases:
1. Designate `msg.sender` as the initial `owner`, and transfer ownership to the chosen owner after deployment.
2. Implement a *two-step ownership change process* through which the new `owner` needs to accept ownership.
3. If it needs to be possible to set the `owner` to `address(0)`, implement a `renounceOwnership` function.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>


### 50. TOB-UNI-005

**Finding**: Incorrect comparison enables swapping and token draining at no cost

**Description**:

An incorrect comparison in the `swap` function allows the swap to succeed even if no tokens are paid. This issue could be used to drain any pool of all of its tokens at no cost.

```soldity
// INSECURE CODE from UniswapV3Pool.swap
require(balanceBefore.add(uint256(amountIn)) >= balanceOfToken(tokenIn), 'IIA');
```

The swap function calculates how many tokens the initiator (`msg.sender`) needs to pay (`amountIn`) to receive the requested amount of tokens (`amountOut`). It then calls the `uniswapV3SwapCallback` function on the initiator’s account, passing in the amount of tokens to be paid. The callback function should then transfer at least the requested amount of tokens to the pool contract. Afterward, a `require` inside the swap function verifies that the correct amount of tokens (`amountIn`) has been transferred to the pool. However, the check inside the `require` is incorrect. The operand used is `>=` instead of `<=`.

**Recommendation**: Replace `>=` with `<=` in the `require` statement.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>


### 51. TOB-UNI-006

**Finding**: Unbound loop enables denial of service

**Description**: The `swap` function relies on an unbounded loop. An attacker could disrupt `swap` operations by forcing the loop to go through too many operations, potentially trapping the `swap` due to a lack of gas.

```solidity
// INSECURE CODE from UniswapV3Pool.swap
while (state.amountSpecifiedRemaining != 0 && state.sqrtPriceX96 != sqrtPriceLimitX96) {
  // function iterates over ticks
}
```

**Recommendation**: Bound the loops and document the bounds.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>


### 52. TOB-UNI-007

**Finding**: Front-running pool’s initialization can lead to draining of liquidity provider’s initial deposits

**Description**:

A front-run on `UniswapV3Pool.initialize` allows an attacker to set an unfair price and to drain assets from the first deposits.

```solidity
// INSECURE CODE from UniswapV3Pool.initialize
function initialize(uint160 sqrtPriceX96) external override {
  // NO ACCESS CONTROL
}
```

There are no access controls on the `initialize` function, so anyone could call it on a deployed pool. Initializing a pool with an incorrect price allows an attacker to generate profits from the initial liquidity provider’s deposits.

**Recommendation**:

Either:
1. move the price operations from `initialize` to the `constructor`
2. add access controls to `initialize`
3. ensure that the documentation clearly warns users about incorrect initialization

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>


### 53. TOB-UNI-008

**Finding**: Swapping on zero liquidity allows for control of the pool’s price

**Description**:

Swapping on a tick with zero liquidity enables a user to adjust the price of `1 wei` of tokens in any direction. As a result, an attacker could set an arbitrary price at the pool’s initialization or if the liquidity providers withdraw all of the liquidity for a short time.

**Recommendation**: No straightforward way to prevent the issue. Ensure pools don’t end up in unexpected states. Warn users of potential risks.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>


### 54. TOB-UNI-009

**Finding**: Failed transfer may be overlooked due to lack of contract existence check

**Description**:

Because the pool fails to check that a contract exists, the pool may assume that failed transactions involving destructed tokens are successful.

`TransferHelper.safeTransfer` performs a transfer with a low-level call without confirming the contract’s existence.

```solidity
// INSECURE CODE from TransferHelper.safeTransfer()
(bool success, bytes memory data) =
    token.call(
      abi.encodeWithSelector(
        IERC20Minimal.transfer.selector,
        to,
        value
      )
    );
require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), 'TF');

```

> "The low level call, delegatecall, and callcode will return sucess if the calling account is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Existence must be checked prior to calling if desired" - Solidity Docs

As a result, if the tokens have not yet been deployed or have been destroyed, `safeTransfer` will return `true` even though no transfer was executed.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, check the contract’s existence prior to the low-level call in `TransferHelper.safeTransfer`.
- Long term, avoid low-level calls.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>

## DFX Finance Audit

[Report](https://github.com/dfx-finance/protocol/blob/main/audits/2021-05-03-Trail_of_Bits.pdf)

### 55. DFX Finance

**Finding**: Use of undefined behavior in equality check

**Description**: On the left-hand side of the equality check, there is an assignment of the variable `outputAmt_`. The right-hand side uses the same variable. The Solidity 0.7.3. documentation states that:

> “The evaluation order of expressions is not specified (more formally, the order in which the children of one node in the expression tree are evaluated is not specified, but they are of course evaluated before the node itself). It is only guaranteed that statements are executed in order and short-circuiting for boolean expressions is done”

which means that this check constitutes an instance of undefined behavior. As such, the behavior of this code is not specified and could change in a future release of Solidity.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, rewrite the `if` statement such that it does not use and assign the same variable in an equality check.
- Long term, ensure that the codebase does not contain undefined Solidity or EVM behavior.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>


### 56. DFX Finance

**Finding**: Assimilators’ balance functions return raw values

**Description**: The system converts raw values to numeraire values for its internal arithmetic. However, in one instance it uses raw values alongside numeraire values. Interchanging raw and numeraire values will produce unwanted results and may result in loss of funds for liquidity provider.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, change the semantics of the three functions listed above in the CADC, XSGD, and EURS assimilators to return the numeraire balance.
- Long term, use unit tests and fuzzing to ensure that all calculations return the expected values. Additionally, ensure that changes to the Shell Protocol do not introduce bugs such as this one.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>


### 57. DFX Finance

**Finding**: System always assumes USDC is equivalent to USD

**Description**: Throughout the system, assimilators are used to facilitate the processing of various stablecoins. However, the `UsdcToUsdAssimilator`’s implementation of the `getRate` method does not use the USDC-USD oracle provided by Chainlink; instead, it assumes 1 USDC is always worth 1 USD. A deviation in the exchange rate of 1 USDC = 1 USD could result in exchange errors.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, replace the hard-coded integer literal in the `UsdcToUsdAssimilator`’s `getRate` method with a call to the relevant Chainlink oracle, as is done in other assimilator contracts.  
- Long term, ensure that the system is robust against a decrease in the price of any stablecoin.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>


### 58. DFX Finance

**Finding**: Assimilators use a deprecated Chainlink API

**Description**: The old version of the Chainlink price feed API (`AggregatorInterface`) is used throughout the contracts and tests. For example, the deprecated function `latestAnswer` is used. This function is not present in the latest API reference (`AggregatorInterfaceV3`). However, it is present in the deprecated API reference. In the worst-case scenario, the deprecated contract could cease to report the latest values, which would very likely cause liquidity providers to incur losses.

**Recommendation**: Use the latest stable versions of any external libraries or contracts leveraged by the codebase

**Severity**: Undetermined

## 0x Protocol Audit

[Report](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/0x-protocol.pdf)

### 59. 0x Protocol

**Finding**: `cancelOrdersUpTo` can be used to permanently block future orders

**Description**: Users can cancel an arbitrary number of future orders, and this operation is not reversible. The `cancelOrdersUpTo` function (Figure 3.1) can cancel an arbitrary number of orders in a single, fixed-size transaction. This function uses a parameter to discard any order with `salt` less than the input value. However, `cancelOrdersUpTo` can cancel future orders if it is called with a very large value (e.g., `MAX_UINT256 - 1`). This operation will cancel future orders, except for the one with `salt` equal to `MAX_UINT256`.

**Recommendation**: Properly document this behavior to warn users about the permanent effects of `cancelOrderUpTo` on future orders. Alternatively, disallow the cancelation of future orders.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>


### 60. 0x Protocol

**Finding**: Specification-Code mismatch for `AssetProxyOwner` timelock period:

**Description**: The specification for `AssetProxyOwner` says:

> "The AssetProxyOwner is a time-locked multi-signature wallet that has permission to perform administrative functions within the protocol. Submitted transactions must pass a 2 week timelock before they are executed."

The `MultiSigWalletWithTimeLock.sol` and `AssetProxyOwner.sol` contracts' timelock-period implementation/usage does not enforce the two-week period, but is instead configurable by the wallet owner without any range checks. Either the specification is outdated (most likely), or this is a serious flaw.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, implement the necessary range checks to enforce the timelock described in the specification. Otherwise correct the specification to match the intended behavior.
- Long term, make sure implementation and specification are in sync. Use Echidna or Manticore to test that your code properly implements the specification.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>


### 61. 0x Protocol

**Finding**: Unclear documentation on how order filling can fail

**Description**: The 0x documentation is unclear about how to determine whether orders are fillable or not. Even some fillable orders cannot be completely filled. The 0x specification does not state clearly enough how fillable orders are determined.

**Recommendation**: Define a proper procedure to determine if an order is fillable and document it in the protocol specification. If necessary, warn the user about potential constraints on the orders.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>


### 62. 0x Protocol

**Finding**: Market makers have a reduced cost for performing front-running attacks

**Description**: Market makers receive a portion of the protocol fee for each order filled, and the protocol fee is based on the transaction gas price. Therefore market makers are able to specify a higher gas price for a reduced overall transaction rate, using the refund they will receive upon disbursement of protocol fee pools.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, properly document this issue to make sure users are aware of this risk. Establish a reasonable cap for the `protocolFeeMultiplier` to mitigate this issue.
- Long term, consider using an alternative fee that does not depend on the `tx.gasprice` to avoid reducing the cost of performing front-running attacks.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>


### 63. 0x Protocol

**Finding**: `setSignatureValidatorApproval` race condition may be exploitable

**Description**: If a validator is compromised, a race condition in the signature validator approval logic becomes exploitable. The `setSignatureValidatorApproval` function (Figure 4.1) allows users to delegate the signature validation to a contract. However, if the validator is compromised, a race condition in this function could allow an attacker to validate any amount of malicious transactions.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, document this behavior to make sure users are aware of the inherent risks of using validators in case of a compromise.
- Long term, consider monitoring the blockchain using the `SignatureValidatorApproval` events to catch front-running attacks.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>


### 64. 0x Protocol

**Finding**: Batch processing of transaction execution and order matching may lead to exchange griefing

**Description**: Batch processing of transaction execution and order matching will iteratively process every transaction and order, which all involve filling. If the asset being filled does not have enough allowance, the asset’s `transferFrom` will fail, causing `AssetProxyDispatcher` to revert. `NoThrow` variants of batch processing, which are available for filling orders, are not available for transaction execution and order matching. So if one transaction or order fails this way, the entire batch will revert and will have to be re-submitted after the reverting transaction is removed.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, implement `NoThrow` variants for batch processing of transaction execution and order matching.
- Long term, take into consideration the effect of malicious inputs when implementing functions that perform a batch of operations.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>


### 65. 0x Protocol

**Finding**: Zero fee orders are possible if a user performs transactions with a zero gas price

**Description**: Users can submit valid orders and avoid paying fees if they use a zero gas price. The computation of fees for each transaction is performed in the `calculateFillResults` function. It uses the gas price selected by the user and the `protocolFeeMultiplier` coefficient. Since the user completely controls the gas price of their transaction and the price could even be zero, the user could feasibly avoid paying fees.

**Recommendation**:
- Short term, select a reasonable minimum value for the protocol fee for each order or transaction.
- Long term, consider not depending on the gas price for the computation of protocol fees. This will avoid giving miners an economic advantage in the system.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>


### 66. 0x Protocol

**Finding**: Calls to `setParams` may set invalid values and produce unexpected behavior in the staking contracts

**Description**: Certain parameters of the contracts can be configured to invalid values, causing a variety of issues and breaking expected interactions between contracts. `setParams` allows the owner of the staking contracts to reparameterize critical parameters. However, reparameterization lacks sanity/threshold/limit checks on all parameters.

**Recommendation**: Add proper validation checks on all parameters in `setParams`. If the validation procedure is unclear or too complex to implement on-chain, document the potential issues that could produce invalid values.

**Severity**: <span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>
